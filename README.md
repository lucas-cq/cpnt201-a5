## Code Review
I used [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for my assignment. I started with bootstrap but I wanted something more hands on. At first I struggled to see the point of tailwind but then grew to like it. Throwing in a simple class here and there for quick design was handy. Something bootstrap did, but with less customizability imo. Setting up with npm was frustrating but it worked out in the end. My terminal is starting to grow on me.
